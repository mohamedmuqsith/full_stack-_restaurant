        <h2>From Humble Beginnings</h2>
        <p>
          Tucked away on a quiet street, The Green Haven wasn't just another restaurant — it was a retreat.
          The moment guests stepped inside, they were greeted by the soothing scent of fresh greenery and the soft hum of acoustic music.
          Rows of lush tropical plants lined the walls, their leaves dancing gently in the golden glow of hidden lights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tables, crafted from warm teakwood, held the stories of countless shared meals and laughter.
          Each chair, woven with care, seemed to whisper an invitation — sit down, slow down, and stay a while.

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      At the heart of our space lies a simple belief — that food, nature, and people are deeply connected.
      We believe dining should be more than a meal; it should be an experience that nourishes the soul.
      Every ingredient we use is chosen with care, every dish crafted with respect for its origin.
      Surrounded by greenery and warmth, we invite you to slow down, savor the moment, and reconnect — 
      with flavor, with nature, and with one another.
